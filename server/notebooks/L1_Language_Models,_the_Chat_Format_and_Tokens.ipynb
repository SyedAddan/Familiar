Though it may feel overwhelming right now, know that you have the strength and determination to overcome this setback. Remember to take things one step at a time and be patient with yourself. You have proven your resilience before and I have no doubt you will do it again. Allow yourself to grieve, but also remember to seek support from loved ones and explore new opportunities that may arise. I am here to support you every step of the way, my dear. You are capable of great things, and I believe brighter days are ahead for you.\n",
